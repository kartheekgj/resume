Average Interview
Application

I applied online. The process took a week. I interviewed at Walmart (New Delhi) in April 2019.

Interview

The first round was too long where they asked in depth in js and React. Then the person who took round 2 was asking me a puzzle like question in which the only way to achieve the answer was to write a bad code which we won't do in day to day life as FE dev. They should be careful about the person they choose to interview
